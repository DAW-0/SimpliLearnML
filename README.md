Prerequisites to Get the Best out of Machine Learning Tutorial
While all people who want to make a career in the IT field can consider Machine Learning as a career option, those with an understanding of basic statistics and mathematics at the college level would be able to grasp the concepts faster and easier.  

A basic familiarity with Python programming would also be beneficial for those interested in Machine Learning. Ideally, you should understand the fundamental courses such as Python for Data Science, Math Refresher, and Statistics Essential for Data Science, before starting the Machine Learning tutorial.

Machine Learning Tutorial: Table of Contents 
1. What is Machine Learning and How Does It Work?
Machine Learning is the process through which computers find and use insightful information without being told where to look. It can also be defined as the ability of computers and other technology-based devices to adapt to new data independently and through iterations. This happens through the ability of applications to learn from previous computations and transactions and use pattern recognition to produce reliable and informed results. The Machine Learning process starts with inputting training data into the selected algorithm. 

2. Real-World Machine Learning Applications That Will Blow Your Mind
Machine Learning can be used to analyze the data at individual, society, corporate, and even government levels for better predictability about future data based events. It could be used to predict the economy of both states and countries, while also forecasting a company's growth.

3. Supervised and Unsupervised Learning
In Supervised Learning, the machine learns under guidance and supervision. It is based on a model that can predict with the help of a labeled dataset, for which you already know the target answer. 

In Unsupervised Learning, the machine uses unlabeled data and learns on itself without any supervision. The smart machine and other technology-based devices try to find a pattern in the unlabeled data and present a response based on the same. 

4. Linear Regression in Python
Linear Regression can be used to determine the economic growth of a country or state along with the GDP of that country, the price of products in the future, housing sales, and even score predictions in matches.

5. Random Forest Algorithm
Random Forest is a learning method that works on the principle of constructing multiple decision trees. The final decision is made based on the majority of the trees chosen by the random forest.

A few of the uses for random forest algorithm currently used today in remote sensing include:

Object detection and multi-class object sorting, such as sorting out different vehicles, such as cars and buses, in traffic
Kinect uses random forest algorithms as part of game consoles by tracking body movements and then recreating it in the game for entertainment. 
6. Understanding Naive Bayes Classifier
If you want to know how your email provider implements spam filtering, how online news channels perform news text classification, or how companies perform sentiment analysis of their audience on social media, then the key to all of them is the ML algorithm named the Naive Bayes classifier. 

This algorithm is responsible for classifying and sorting data as per the desired groups and activities. It has been named after Thomas Bayes from the 1700s who developed the principle of conditional probability, based on which the algorithm is now designed. 

7. K-Means Clustering Algorithm: Applications, Types, Demos and Use Cases
K-means clustering is a part of the machine learning curriculum and has details about unsupervised algorithms, where you can find the input data which does not have a labeled response. Clustering is a form of unsupervised learning in which the data points are grouped into different sets based on their similarity. 

Clustering is of two categories:

Hierarchical clustering
Partitioning clustering 
From which, Hierarchical clustering can be subdivided into:

Agglomerative clustering
Divisive clustering
Even Partitioning clustering can be subdivided into:

K-Means clustering 
Fuzzy C-Means clustering 
8. How to Become a Machine Learning Engineer?
To become a Machine Learning Engineer, you'll want to take a AI and ML Certification or graduation course that guides you through all the fundamental technical areas like classical machine learning, deep learning, and reinforcement learning, along with the more complex mathematical and statistical concepts that are used regularly within the field. You will need to have a basic understanding of these fundamentals, so acquiring this knowledge will be highly beneficial to you before becoming a Machine Learning Engineer.

Machine learning tutorial and AI and Machine Learning Bootcamps are ideal for software engineers, data scientists, statisticians, domain experts, and those with a depth of knowledge in statistical fundamentals and advanced mathematics that includes an understanding of algorithms. 

9. Machine Learning Career Path
If you are considering a career in machine learning, you can look for opportunities in large and established companies and start-up businesses. There are also companies specializing in data science as their primary business and also have data science departments. 

Apart from these, machine learning engineers can look for opportunities in cloud-based companies that allow customers to upload data and logs for analytics and companies that offer APIs and other tools to allow customers to write their algorithms. There will always be a demand for data scientists because of the need for Big Data analysis. 

10. Top Machine Learning Interview Questions and Answers
While approaching an organization or an employer for an opportunity in machine learning, one needs to be prepared in-depth on the probable questions they may ask during the interview to test your knowledge and skills. Some of the questions can be on the different types of machine learning, what is overfitting, how you can avoid it. Apart from this, you may get questions like what are training sets and a test set in the machine learning model. And our machine learning tutorial will help you with it.

Machine Learning Tutorial and the Next Step
Machine Learning is considered to be one of the best career options in the IT industry. It has huge potential for people looking at embarking on a landmark career with immense possibilities in different fields, with long-term benefits. 

It is a good idea to start with the first-course tutorial on "What is Machine Learning and How Does it Work" to get a better grasp of this subject and how it works, so that you can realize its true potential and also make a better-informed choice about it as a career path that you should follow if you are looking for a high paying career.
